# INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE & FUNDING FRAMEWORK

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the institutional-grade governance structure, funding requirements, and SR-level engineering controls required for $100M+ AUM deployment and institutional investor participation.

---

## 1. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

### 1.1 Multi-Signature Authorization (On-Chain)

**Configuration:**
```
Signers: 5 independent parties
Threshold: 3-of-5 (60% approval)

```

**Authorized Actions (Require Multi-Sig):**
- Contract upgrades (UUPS proxy implementation)
- Compliance registry modifications
- Transfer gate settings changes
- Emergency pause/unpause

## 3. SR-LEVEL ENGINEERING STANDARDS

### 3.1 Code Quality Metrics

**Target Thresholds:**
| Metric | Target | Minimum |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Test Coverage | 95%+ | 85% |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | <10 | <15 |
| Code Duplication | <2% | <5% |
| Security Issues (Slither) | 0 critical | 0 critical, <3 high |
| Dependency Vulnerabilities | 0 | 0 |
| Performance (Gas) | <100k gas/tx | <200k gas/tx |

# Test coverage
cd contracts && npx hardhat coverage --testfiles 'test/**/*compliance*.js'

# Security analysis
slither . --json slither-report.json

# Code quality
npm run lint
solhint 'src/**/*.sol'

# Gas optimization
npx hardhat test --reporter eth-gas-reporter
```

### 3.2 Deployment Safety Controls

**Circuit Breakers (Automatic Triggers):**
```solidity
// Pause if:
if (dailyVolume > threshold_volume) {
    _pause();  // Block all transfers
}

// Pause if:
if (sanctionsFailureCount > threshold) {
    _pause();  // Sanctions screening down
}

// Pause if:
if (kycApprovalRate < threshold_percentage) {
    _pause();  // Compliance bottleneck detected
}

// Resume only via:
// 1. Multi-sig approval
// 2. Automatic after 7 days (with notification)
```

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
```yaml
Datadog Dashboards:
  - KYC approval rates (target: >95%)
  - Transfer completion rates (target: >98%)
  - Sanctions screening success (target: 100%)
  - Gas price trends
  - Network latency
  - Error rates by endpoint

Sentry Alerts (Critical):

  - Contract interaction failures
  - Database connection errors
  - Compliance service timeouts
  - Unauthorized access attempts
```

### 3.3 Audit Trail & Immutability
