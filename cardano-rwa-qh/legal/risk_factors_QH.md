# Risk Factors — Quebrada Honda I & II (Phase 1)

- Technical Uncertainty — NI 43-101 (2020) is the baseline; updated pricing in 2024 does not re-classify resources.
- Permitting Boundaries — Phase-1 relies on small-mining/sectoral permits; scale-ups can trigger full EIA with longer timelines.
- Commodity Price Volatility — Au/Cu/Ag price swings affect Net Revenue and royalty.
- Operational Execution — Ramp-up delays, grade variability, metallurgy, availability of power, water, and equipment.
- Offtake/Counterparty Risk — ENAMI/other buyers; logistics disruptions; payment terms.
- Regulatory/Tax Changes — Changes to royalties, export rules, sanctions.
- Token Transferability — Restricted under Reg D/Reg S; allowlist enforcement can block transfers not in compliance.
- Key Management & Security — Custody of mint/treasury keys; cyber and operational controls are critical.
- Force Majeure — Weather, seismic activity, political events.
