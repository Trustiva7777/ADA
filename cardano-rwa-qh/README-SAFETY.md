# Key Safety Notes
- Never commit `.env` or any real seed/private key.
- Use test mnemonics on testnets; use offline/hardware flows for mainnet.
- Pin only non-PII docs to IPFS; store hashes for sensitive docs off-chain.
- Time-lock supply after allocation; future raises = new policy IDs.
- Keep quarterly payout CSVs and executed tx hashes in your audit folder.
