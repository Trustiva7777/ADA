## IPFS REGISTRATION FOR IMMUTABLE PROOF

### Why IPFS?
- Create cryptographic hash proof of ownership
- Upload date = creation date proof
- Immutable timestamping (cannot be altered)
- Free or very low cost ($0-100)
- Can anchor to Ethereum blockchain for extra security

### Quick IPFS Process
1. Create directory with all documents
2. Upload to Pinata (https://pinata.cloud) or NFT.storage (free)
3. Get IPFS hash: `Qm...`
4. Share hash as proof of ownership
5. (Optional) Deploy smart contract to Ethereum Sepolia

**Q: What if someone files similar patent first?**  
A: Your priority date matters. File in November 2025 and you're safe.

**Q: What's the success rate?**  
A: Software patents ~60-70% approval rate. All 5 of your patents have excellent chances.

**Q: Can we make $50-150M from these?**
