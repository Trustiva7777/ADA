restart_policy:
  condition: unless-stopped
  delay: 5s
  max_attempts: 3
  window: 120s
```

**Finding 3-4: Secrets Review**
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Status:** ✅ PASS (No actual hardcoded secrets found)
- **Note:** References to `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in env_file are correct patterns
- **Verification:** No credentials found in code files

### Security Best Practices Compliance
- ✅ Principle of least privilege (non-root containers)
- ✅ Defense in depth (multiple layers of security)
- ✅ Secrets management (environment variables)
- ✅ Network isolation (Docker networks)
