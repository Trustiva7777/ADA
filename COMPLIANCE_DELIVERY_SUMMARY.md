- **Purpose:** Enterprise KYC/AML with immutable audit trail
- **Key Features:**
  - KYC submission → approval → renewal → expiry cycle
  - OFAC/PEP/Adverse media screening integration
  - Jurisdiction-based access control
  - Tiered accreditation (Accredited, Qualified, Institutional)
  - Immutable compliance audit trail
  - Multi-role access (COMPLIANCE_ROLE, REVIEWER_ROLE, EMERGENCY_ROLE)
  - Account blocking for sanctions matches
  
- **Public Functions:**
  ```solidity
  submitKYC(investor, nameHash, jurisdiction, accreditationLevel, documentHash)
  approveKYC(investor)
  renewKYC(investor)
  isKYCValid(account) → bool
  isKYCExpired(account) → bool
  setSanctionsFlag(account, screenResult)
  setPEPFlag(account, isPEP)
